## About myself

I'm 27 years old burn surgeon. As funny as it may sound, I think I'm burning out. But without going into the reasons, if you want to know something about me, it's that this profession has left its mark on me. I am calm, patient, persistent, resolute and have high communicative skills. Despite this, I am an introvert. Coding is an interesting challenge for me, a way of self-realization, a way to my main paradigm - freedom. I have no commercial programming experience, but it's a matter of time.

## Skills

};
